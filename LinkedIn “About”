I’m one of those people who genuinely enjoys building models and asking, “Does this actually make sense in the real world?”

I’m currently a Master’s student in Quantitative Economics & Data Science at Columbia University, with prior internships across investment banking and private equity – including a $300M healthcare private placement and roll-up work in real estate / services. I like being close to the numbers and close to the decision: understanding how a business actually makes money, what can break, and what needs to be true for a deal to work.

A big turning point for me was realizing I could use investing to change my own trajectory: starting with a small account and, over time, paying off my undergraduate tuition through my own investments. That experience shaped how I think about risk, conviction, and downside protection – and made me want to spend my career where capital, strategy, and real businesses intersect.

What I do well:

Build and audit financial models (DCF, LBO-style, roll-up cases) and tie them back to real operating drivers

Use data (Python, Excel, statistics) to move from “I have a hunch” to “I can show you why this matters”

Synthesize messy information into clean memos, investment notes, and slides that non-technical people can act on

Work across cultures (US / Asia) and contexts – from boutique private equity to institutional environments

Right now, I’m especially interested in:

Private equity / growth investing in services, consumer, and specialty niches

Research / investing roles where junior team members actually see the full deal process

Opportunities to combine data, economics, and investing in a way that’s hands-on and long-term oriented

If you’re building a team where juniors get real responsibility and exposure – or if you just enjoy talking about investing, roll-ups, or career paths in finance – I’d love to connect.
